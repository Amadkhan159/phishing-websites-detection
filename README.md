# Phishing Website Detection with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)

# Overview
This project aims to detect phishing websites using artificial neural networks (ANNs). Phishing attacks pose a significant threat to users’ security, and identifying fraudulent URLs is crucial. By leveraging deep learning techniques, we can build an effective model to distinguish between legitimate and phishing URLs.

# Key Components
 1. Feature Extraction:
    Extract relevant features from URLs, including length, domain age, presence of special characters, and more.
    Convert URLs into fixed-size matrices for input to the neural network.
    
 2. Model Architecture:
    Utilize recurrent neural networks (RNNs), such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), to capture sequential patterns in URLs.
    Train the model on labeled data (phishing vs. legitimate URLs).

# Evaluation Metrics
Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Fine-tune hyperparameters to achieve optimal results.

# Deployment
Integrate the trained model into a web service, allowing users to input URLs for prediction.
